              BigStore is a demo e-commerce website built as a side project to
              showcase my skills in Next.js, Supabase, Chakra UI, and more. It
              features a list of products fetched from JSONPlaceholder, a cart
              system where users can add, delete, and update quantities, and an
              authentication system requiring users to sign up before placing
              orders. Upon ordering, users receive a confirmation email via
              MailerSend. They can also log in to manage their orders, including
              canceling them. This is a fake storeâ€”nothing is real, and it's
              purely for demonstration purposes.
